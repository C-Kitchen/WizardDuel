# WizardDuel
"Physics"-based wizard game. All the game objects behave like billiard balls of various sizes crashing into each other.

Collect orbs of different colors. If you touch an orb of a color you've already collected, it shoots off as a fireball. If you're hit by a fireball, you lose the corresponding color if you have it. If you don't you die.
